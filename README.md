Module 10 - Climate Analysis

For climate_starter I based a lot of the code from class lessons, particularly the instructor lessons on dates and student exercise on "Dow dates". I looked up Pandas documentation to make sure how to sort values correctly.  I also looked up Pandas documentation for histogram plotting and correct syntax for rotating xticks.

For the climate app, I based a lot of the code from the instructor lessons "Flask with ORM" and "Variable Rule."
